    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta">Listing Lens · The UPD8 Group Pty Ltd · Last updated February 2026</p>

    <p>By using Listing Lens ("the Service"), you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. What the Service does</h2>
    <p>Listing Lens analyses screenshots of marketplace listings you provide and generates a buyer intelligence report. Reports include risk assessments, cost estimates, market comparisons, and suggested questions. Reports are for informational purposes only and do not constitute professional advice.</p>

    <h2>2. What we charge</h2>
    <p>Each report costs $2 AUD (or local equivalent), charged at the time of generation. Payments are processed by Stripe. There are no subscriptions, no hidden fees, and no recurring charges.</p>

    <h2>3. Refunds</h2>
    <p>If a report fails to generate after payment is taken, contact us using the details at the bottom of this page and we will issue a full refund within 2 business days. We do not offer refunds on successfully generated reports, as the service has been delivered.</p>

    <h2>4. Screenshot data and deletion</h2>

    <div class="highlight">
        <p>Uploaded screenshots are automatically and permanently deleted within 15 minutes of upload, regardless of whether a report was generated or whether payment was completed. This is not a preference — it is how the system is built.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Specifically: your screenshots are stored temporarily in encrypted storage (Netlify Blobs) with a 15-minute expiry. On successful report generation, they are deleted immediately — before the 15-minute limit expires. If report generation fails or is never attempted, the expiry ensures automatic deletion. We do not back up, archive, or retain screenshots under any circumstances.</p>

    <p>Reports are generated and transmitted to your browser. We do not retain a copy of your report on our servers. Once your browser session ends, the report exists only on your device.</p>

    <h2>5. What we do not store</h2>
    <p>We do not collect or store your name, email address, phone number, or any other personal identifying information. We do not require account creation. We do not log what listings you scan or what reports you receive. We do not use cookies for tracking or advertising.</p>

    <h2>6. Report accuracy</h2>
    <p>Reports are generated by AI and augmented with web search results. While we aim for accuracy, reports may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information. Listing Lens reports are a starting point for your due diligence — not a substitute for professional inspections, legal advice, or financial advice. Always conduct your own independent research before making purchasing decisions.</p>

    <h2>7. Screenshot content and third-party rights</h2>
    <p>By uploading screenshots, you confirm that you have the right to use those images for personal research and due diligence purposes. You are responsible for ensuring your use of the Service complies with any applicable terms of service of the platforms from which the screenshots were taken. We use your screenshots solely to generate your report and for no other purpose.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>The Listing Lens report format, design system, and analysis methodology are the intellectual property of The UPD8 Group Pty Ltd. Your report is yours to use for personal purposes. You may not resell or republish reports generated by this Service.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>Listing Lens and The UPD8 Group Pty Ltd are not liable for any loss or damage arising from reliance on a report, including but not limited to financial loss from a purchasing decision made on the basis of a report. The Service is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to these terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. Material changes will be noted on this page with an updated date.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>Questions about these terms, refund requests, or any other enquiries: <a href="mailto:listinglens@upd8.group">listinglens@upd8.group</a>. We aim to respond within 5 business days.</p>
